üìÑ Project Title:
Clinic Management System Website (Test-Based)

üìù Project Description:
The Clinic Management System Website is a simple, front-end-only project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This test-based system simulates the basic functionality of a real clinic management system but does not include a backend or database connection. It is designed as a beginner-level project to showcase how different parts of a clinic website can be structured and styled.

The website includes essential pages like Home, Login, Appointment, Contact, Doctors List, and Doctor Profile. These pages are static and serve as a user interface prototype for how a real clinic management system might function in a more advanced version with backend support.

üéØ Purpose of the Project:
To practice and demonstrate web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To create a visual prototype for a clinic management website.

To understand the structure and navigation between multiple pages of a web application.

To simulate the process of booking appointments and viewing doctor profiles without real-time data.

‚ú® Key Features:
Home Page

Welcome message with brief info about the clinic.

Navigation menu for easy access to all pages.

Login Page

Simple test-based login form (no validation or real authentication).

Used just for layout and practice purposes.

Appointment Page

Form where users can "book" an appointment (form does not actually submit data).

Fields like Name, Date, Time, Doctor Selection, and Reason.

Contact Page

Static form to collect user messages (not functional).
